The Anchor Tag and the Name Attribute 
The name attribute is used to create a named anchor. When using named anchors we can create links 
that can jump directly to a specific section on a page, instead of letting the user scroll around to find 
what he/she is looking for. Unlike an anchor that uses href, a named anchor doesn't change the 
appearance of the text (unless you set styles for that anchor) or indicate in any way that there is 
anything special about the text. Below is the syntax of a named anchor: 
 
<a name="top">Text to be displayed</a> 
 
To link directly to the top section, add a # sign and the name of the anchor to the end of a URL, like 
this:
