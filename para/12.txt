Example Explained 
What you just made is a skeleton html document. This is the minimum required information for a web 
document and all web documents should contain these basic components. The first tag in your html 
document is <html>. This tag tells your browser that this is the start of an html document. The last 
tag in your document is </html>. This tag tells your browser that this is the end of the html 
document. 
 
The text between the <head> tag and the </head> tag is header information. Header information is not 
displayed in the browser window. 
 
The text between the <title> tags is the title of your document. The <title> tag is used to uniquely 
identify each document and is also displayed in the title bar of the browser window.  
 
The text between the <body> tags is the text that will be displayed in your browser. 
 
The text between the <b> and </b> tags will be displayed in a bold font. 
 
HTM or HTML Extension? 
When you save an HTML file, you can use either the .htm or the .html extension. The .htm extension 
comes from the past when some of the commonly used software only allowed three letter extensions. 
It is perfectly safe to use either .html or .htm, but be consistent. mypage.htm and mypage.html are 
treated as different files by the browser.

open a window that shows you the actual HTML of the page. Go ahead and view the source html for 
this page.
