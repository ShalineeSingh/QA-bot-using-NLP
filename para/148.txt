Tables are defined with the <table> tag. A table is divided into rows (with the <tr> tag), and each row 
is divided into data cells (with the <td> tag). The letters td stands for table data, which is the content 
of a data cell. A data cell can contain text, images, lists, paragraphs, forms, horizontal rules, tables, 
etc.
