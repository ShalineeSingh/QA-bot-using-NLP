Cellspacing is the pixel width between the individual data cells in the table (The thickness of the lines 
making the table grid). The default is zero. If the border is set at 0, the cellspacing lines will be 
invisible.  
 
This Code  Would Display  
<table border="1" cellspacing="5"> 
<tr> 
<td>some text</td> 
<td>some text</td> 
</tr><tr> 
<td>some text</td> 
<td>some text</td>
