 
Cellpadding is the pixel space between the cell contents and the cell border. The default for this 
property is also zero. This feature is not used often, but sometimes comes in handy when you have 
your borders turned on and you want the contents to be away from the border a bit for easy viewing. 
Cellpadding is invisible, even with the border property turned on. Cellpadding can be handled in a style 
sheet.  
 
This Code  Would Display 
<table border="1" cellpadding="10"> 
<tr> 
<td>some text</td> 
<td>some text</td> 
</tr><tr> 
<td>some text</td> 
<td>some text</td> 
</tr> 
</table>
