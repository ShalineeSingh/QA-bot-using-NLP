Table Width  
The width attribute can be used to define the width of your table. It can be defined as a fixed width or 
a relative width. A fixed table width is one where the width of the table is specified in pixels. For 
example, this code, <table width="550">, will produce a table that is 550 pixels wide. A relative table 
width is specified as a percentage of the width of the visitor's viewing window. Hence this code, <table 
width="80%">, will produce a table that occupies 80 percent of the screen. 
 
This table width is 250 pixels 
 
This table width is 50%
