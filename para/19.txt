Physical tags were invented to add style to HTML pages because style sheets were not around, though 
the original intention of HTML was to not have physical tags. Rather than use physical tags to style 
your HTML pages, you should use style sheets. 
 
HTML Elements 
Remember the HTML example from the previous page: 
 
<html>  
<head>  
<title>My First Webpage</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
This is my first homepage. <b>This text is bold</b>  
</body>  
</html> 
 
This is an HTML element: 
 
<b>This text is bold</b>  
 
The HTML element begins with a start tag: <b>
The content of the HTML element is: This text is bold 
The HTML element ends with an end tag: </b>
 
The purpose of the <b> tag is to define an HTML element that should be displayed as bold. 
 
This is also an HTML element: 
 
<body>  
This is my first homepage. <b>This text is bold</b>  
</body>
 
This HTML element starts with the start tag <body>, and ends with the end tag </body>. The purpose 
of the <body> tag is to define the HTML element that contains the body of the HTML document. 
 
Nested Tags  
You may have noticed in the example above, the <body> tag also contains other tags, like the <b> tab. 
When you enclose an element in with multiple tags, the last tag opened should be the first tag closed. 
For example: 
 
<p><b><em>This is NOT the proper way to close nested tags.</p></em></b>
 
<p><b><em>This is the proper way to close nested tags. </em></b></p>
