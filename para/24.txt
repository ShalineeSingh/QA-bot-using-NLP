This tag defines an HTML table: <table>. With an added border attribute, you can tell the browser that 
the table should have no borders: <table border="0">. Attributes always come in name/value pairs 
like this: name="value". Attributes are always added to the start tag of an HTML element and the 
value is surrounded by quotes. 
 
Quote Styles, "red" or 'red'? 
Attribute values should always be enclosed in quotes. Double style quotes are the most common, but 
single style quotes are also allowed. In some rare situations, like when the attribute value itself 
contains quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes: 
 
name='George "machine Gun" Kelly'
