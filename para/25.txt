Note: Some tags we will discuss are deprecated, meaning the World Wide Web Consortium 
(W3C) the governing body that sets HTML, XML, CSS, and other technical standards decided 
those tags and attributes are marked for deletion in future versions of HTML and XHTML. 
Browsers should continue to support deprecated tags and attributes, but eventually these tags 
are likely to become obsolete and so future support cannot be guaranteed.
