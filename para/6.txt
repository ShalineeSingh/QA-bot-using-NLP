Q: What is Notepad and where do I get it? 
A: Notepad is the default Windows text editor. On most Windows systems, click your Start 
button and choose Programs then Accessories. It should be a little blue notebook. 
 
Mac Users: SimpleText is the default text editor on the Mac. In OSX use TextEdit and change 
the following preferences: Select (in the preferences window) Plain text instead of Rich text and 
then select Ignore rich text commands in HTML files. This is very important because if you don't 
do this HTML codes probably won't work.
