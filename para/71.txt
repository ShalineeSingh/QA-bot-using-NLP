 
A character entity has three parts: an ampersand (&), an entity name or an entity number, and finally 
a semicolon (;). The & means we are beginning a special character, the ; means ending a special 
character and the letters in between are sort of an abbreviation for what it's for. To display a less than 
sign in an HTML document we must write: &lt; or &#60; The advantage of using a name instead of a 
number is that a name is easier to remember. The disadvantage is that not all browsers support the 
newest entity names, while the support for entity numbers is very good in almost all browsers.
