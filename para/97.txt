Web Safe Colors 
A few years ago, when most computers supported only 256 different colors, a list of 216 Web Safe 
Colors was suggested as a Web standard. The reason for this was that the Microsoft and Mac operating 
system used 40 different "reserved" fixed system colors (about 20 each). This 216 cross platform web 
safe color palette was originally created to ensure that all computers would display all colors correctly 
when running a 256 color palette. To view the 216 Cross Platform Colors visit this web page:

16 Million Different Colors 
The combination of Red, Green and Blue values from 0 to 255 gives a total of more than 16 million 
different colors to play with (256 x 256 x 256). Most modern monitors are capable of displaying at 
least 16,384 different colors. To assist you in using color schemes, check out
